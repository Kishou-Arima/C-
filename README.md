# C# Project Files 📂
## Just random codes while learning C#

### ⚠️ ___Things to Note___ ⚠️
* The Codes are arranged in their specific folders, each named in the order of `Second`, `Third` and so on.
* The Main codes of each program are in the file `Program.cs` in their root folders.
* The only exception to Rule 1 is the program `First`,which is named as `New`.
